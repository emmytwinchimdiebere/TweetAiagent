- Twitter Developer Account with API keys and tokens

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-ai-agent.git
   cd twitter-ai-agent
   ```

   ```

   Using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

### Twitter API

The application uses the Twitter API to interact with Twitter's services. Ensure you have the following credentials from your Twitter Developer account:

- API Key

### Google API

If your application requires integration with Google services, ensure you have the Google API Key.

## Security

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as API keys and tokens in the `.env.local` file. This file should be added to [`.gitignore`]/Desktop/cdptoolkit/.gitignore" to prevent it from being committed to version control.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of Twitter API rate limits to avoid being blocked.
